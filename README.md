Tic Tac Toe is a very popular card game. It is played on a square grid of 3Ã—3 boxes. In turn, players choose an empty cell and draw their symbol on it (usually one player has an "X" as a symbol and the opponent a circle). The player who manages to arrange three of their symbols in a straight horizontal, vertical or diagonal line wins. If the grid is filled without either player completing a straight line of three symbols, the game ends in a draw. In the event that the game ends in a draw, the game is called a "draw", as in the board game of chess.
